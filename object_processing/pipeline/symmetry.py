"""Geometric rotational-symmetry detection for a mesh.

Detects the *proper* rotational symmetry group of a mesh (cyclic ``Cn`` /
continuous ``Cinf`` about an axis, plus dihedral perpendicular ``C2`` axes) and
records it as per-object metadata (``info/symmetry.json``). Reflections are
intentionally ignored — only proper rotations (the ones that map the solid onto
itself) are reported.

Frame convention
----------------
All axes are reported in the *mesh's own object frame* (the same frame as
``simplified.obj``, ``obb_transform``, and the tabletop poses), and pass through
the mesh center of mass.

Algorithm
---------
1. The inertia tensor's principal axes are the *only* candidate symmetry axes
   (a rotational symmetry axis is always a principal axis of inertia). This is
   cheap and exact, and narrows an SO(3) search to 3 directions.
2. Each candidate axis is *verified* geometrically: rotate a surface point
   sample about the axis and measure the RMS point-to-surface distance back to
   the original mesh, normalized by object scale. Point-to-surface (not
   point-to-point) makes this robust to sampling discretization. A residual
   below ``rel_tol`` means the rotation is a true symmetry.
3. The fold order is the largest ``n`` whose ``2*pi/n`` rotation verifies;
   incommensurate probe angles distinguish continuous (``"inf"``) from discrete.
